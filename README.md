📖 Introduction du README

MayeleAI is an open-source framework designed to bring structure, intent, and discipline to Large Language Models.

Large Language Models are extremely powerful, but when they operate directly on prompts, application code, or loosely defined workflows, their behavior quickly becomes fragile, opaque, and hard to control. As systems grow, business logic, orchestration, and technical concerns tend to collapse into a single unstructured layer.

MayeleAI introduces a different approach.

Instead of letting LLMs manipulate code or infrastructure directly, MayeleAI allows them to reason and operate on explicit business state machines — composable, executable representations of domain logic and workflows. These state machine stacks form a protected semantic layer where business intent is clearly separated from technical implementation.

By enforcing this boundary, MayeleAI makes LLM-driven systems:

easier to reason about,

safer to execute,

more predictable over time,

and better aligned with real-world business domains.

The goal of MayeleAI is simple:
give LLMs discernment — a structured space where intent, rules, and workflows are explicit, constrained, and auditable.
