# Event Accumulation Demo
# Shows how to accumulate multiple events and use EXPLICIT CONTROL for transitions
#
# Use Case: Trading Order that receives multiple execution notifications
# and transitions to "Fully Executed" only when all quantity is executed
#
# Key Pattern: sender.sendToSelf() for explicit transition control

#   runtime.on('triggered_method', async ({ method, event, context, sender }) => { ... })
